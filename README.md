# Student JDBC - Assignment 9

This repository contains the implementation for Student Data Entry with JDBC in Java, focusing on managing and processing student data using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The project demonstrates how to connect to a database, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and handle student records efficiently.

## 📁 Project Structure

   cd student_jdbc-assignment_9
   ```

2. **Set up the Database:**

   - Create a database named `student_db`.
   - Create a table named `students` with appropriate columns (e.g., id, name, age, grade).
   - Update the database connection details in `StudentOperations.java` (URL, username, password).

3. **Compile the Java files:**

   ```bash
   javac Main.java StudentOperations.java
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
